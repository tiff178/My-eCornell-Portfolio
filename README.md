8a Lab - Implement ML Plan 

*Refer to my Jupyter Notebook for more details!*

Over this past summer at UCLA, I delved into various aspects of Machine Learning, from mastering data preprocessing techniques using *Python* and the available Python libraries - *NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn*, and *Seaborn* to understanding the various methods to train our models. Currently, I am working on a real-world industry challenge project with Break Through Tech & We Inspect to analyze how the different mold types may play a factor into peoples' health (Project will be updated onto Github later on).
